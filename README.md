Hackathons
==========

Running a Yeoman hackathon? Start here for ideas, tips, and goals


What's a Yeoman hackathon
----------

Yeoman is really about Open Source Software and developer tooling. A "Yeoman hackathon" should stay around those themes. A couple projects example:

1. Discovering a new framework and creating a generator
2. Helping fixing core issues on `yeoman-generator`, `yo` or any generator
3. Writing a Grunt or a Gulp plugin
4. Improving the documentation and the website
5. Learn Yeoman, Grunt, Gulp, Bower, anything!
6. Make the web a better place

In short: have fun and try contributing to the Open Source community.


What can I do?
---------

First of all, you should probably go through our [contribution guidelines](http://yeoman.io/contributing/).

Understanding [the way we label issues](http://yeoman.io/contributing/ticketing.html) will help you find bugs you can fix or features you can create. The core Yeoman system consist of:

- [yeoman-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-generator) which is the system used by any generator
- [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) which is the command line interface.
- [yeoman-environment](https://github.com/yeoman/environment) which is responsible of handling the lifecyle and bootstrap of generators in a specific environment (your app).
- [yeoman-doctor](https://github.com/yeoman/doctor) which is a script to help users debug their system configuration to run yeoman.
 
You can also check the [Yeoman github organization](https://github.com/yeoman) to see the list of official generators and plugins we maintains. Don't forget you're obviously free to work on other projects that are not related to the yeoman organization.

This repository contains a [list of more demanding project](https://github.com/yeoman/Hackathons/labels/project) any team can start working on during a hackathon.

You have an idea for a Grunt/Gulp plugin? Have an idea for a new generator? Organize a project team and start working on it!


Code of Conduct
---------

We're still working on it. But basically: don't be a jerk.
