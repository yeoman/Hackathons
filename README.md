Hackathons
==========

Running a Yeoman hackathon? Start here for ideas, tips, and goals


What's a Yeoman hackathon
----------

Yeoman is really about Open Source Software and developer tooling. A "Yeoman hackathon" should stay around those themes. A couple projects example:

1. Discovering a new framework and creating a generator
2. Helping fixing core issues on `yeoman-generator`, `yo` or any generator
3. Writing a Grunt or a Gulp plugin
4. Improving the documentation and the website
5. Learn Yeoman, Grunt, Gulp, Bower, anything!
6. Make the web a better place

In short: have fun and try contributing to the Open Source community.


What can I do?
---------

First of all, you should probably go through our [contribution guidelines](http://yeoman.io/contributing/).

Understanding [the way we label issues](http://yeoman.io/contributing/ticketing.html) will help you find bugs you can fix or features you can create. The core Yeoman system consist of [yeoman-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-generator) which is the system used by any generator, and of [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) which is the command line interface. You can also check the [Yeoman github organization](https://github.com/yeoman) to see the list of official generators and plugins we maintains (not that you have to work on "official" stuff).

This repository contains a [list of more demanding project](https://github.com/yeoman/Hackathons/labels/project) any team can start working on during a hackathon.

You have an idea for a Grunt/Gulp plugin? Have an idea for a new generator? Organize a project team and start working on it!


Code of Conduct
---------

We're still working on it. But basically: don't be a jerk.
